# DeFogón
DeFogón is an Android application to forget about bringing you chords book everywhere.

It has many famous, well-known and easy-to-play songs to enjoy at parties and bonfires or to train by yourself. 

No Internet? Don't worry! The app was thought to be used during trips where you are very likely to be offline. 
After the first time you open the app, you don't need Internet anymore until  you want to update the songs list.
